# 2. SvelteKit

Date: 2025-01-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The codebase (frontend) is messy and deviates from common web standards. This negatively impacts development as developers need project-specific knowledge of the system.

## Decision

Proposal to introduce SvelteKit as the frontend framework.

## Consequences

Established frontend framework. Code structure follows SvelteKit's documentation, creating a common understanding.
Delivery will be more reliable and hopefully faster. Facilitates discussions about solutions as we can refer to documentation.
