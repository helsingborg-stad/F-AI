"""
Put concrete service implementation(s) here.

Service(s) perform the module's logic and usually reference
one or more models from <module>/models.

If there are discrete variants of how the logic is executed then
multiple services may be implemented (e.g. PushNotificationService
vs EmailNotificationService).

External dependencies for services are injected by the factory
if necessary. Services do not directly reference external (other modules')
code except for their protocols and models.
